## 🧠 Why Simulation?

This project intentionally **does not call live AI APIs** in order to:

- Avoid paid API credits
- Allow free public deployment on Vercel
- Focus evaluation on:
  - Front-end engineering skill
  - UX design
  - Product logic
  - Architecture decisions

The system is designed so **real AI services (Gemini, OpenAI, etc.) can be plugged in later without refactoring the UI**.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **React**
